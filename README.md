## Purpose
`FFPACK` ( Fatigue and Fracture PACKage ) is an open-source Python library for fatigue and fracture analysis. It supports cycle counting with ASTM methods, load sequence generators, fatigue damage evaluations, etc. A lot of features are under active development. `FFPACK` is designed to help engineers analyze fatigue and fracture behavior in engineering practice.

## Installation

`FFPACK` can be installed via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ffpack/):

```
pip install ffpack
```

## Status

`FFPACK` is currently under active development. 

## Contents

* Fatigue damage rule
* Load correction and counting
* Load sequence generator
* Load spectra and matrices
* Random and probabilistic model
* Risk and reliability model
* Utility methods

## Document

You can find a complete documentation for setting up `FFPACK` at the [Read the Docs site](https://ffpack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
