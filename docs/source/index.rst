FFPACK's Documentation
===================================

**FFPACK** (Fatigue and Fracture PACKage) is a open source Python library for 
fatigue and fracture evaluation.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to create a :ref:`environment` for the project.

.. note::

   Please select the correct version of FFPACK documentation. 
   The version can be found at the upper left under the `FFPACK` title.
   Three versions of documentation are provided:

   * `stable`: the documentation for the most recent released version.
   * `latest`: the documentation for `main` branch.
   * `docs`: the documentation for `docs` branch.

   The `docs` branch and associated `docs` documentation represents 
   the newest documentation under development. Once the documentation is finished, 
   the changes will be merged into `main` branch and the `latest` version 
   will be updated.

   To switch the version, Click `Read the Docs` at the bottom left.
